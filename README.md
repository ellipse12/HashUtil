# HashUtil
HashUtil is a simple Command Line Utility (CLI) for cryptographicaly hashing text input.

I mostly just made this because CertUtil --hashfile on windows hashes the entire file and not just the contents, and because I was bored. (and yes I know CertUtil --hashfile is only for generating checksums for downloads).

there are two downloads, Hash-small which has one executable file that handles everything, but is slightly slower, and Hash-large which is much faster, but is not self-contained.

You will also want to add the files to your systems Path which a tutorial on doing so can be found here: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/add-a-directory-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10/ and just use the path to either the excutable or where you unzipped the folder.
